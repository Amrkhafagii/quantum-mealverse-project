# Google Maps Migration Guide

This document outlines the plan to migrate to a fully standardized Google Maps stack.

## Current Implementation Assessment

Our application currently has a well-structured system with:

- Map service abstractions (WebMapService, MapService interfaces)
- Location tracking hooks and contexts
- Energy efficiency optimizations (BatteryEfficientTracker)
- Advanced geofencing and intelligent tracking

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Build Errors & Ensure Stability

- ✅ Fix TypeScript errors in hooks and services
- ✅ Correct Icon type implementation in WebMapService
- ✅ Ensure consistent interface implementation

### Phase 2: API Integration Standardization

- ⬜️ Consolidate Google Maps API key management
- ⬜️ Implement consistent error handling across services
- ⬜️ Develop centralized retry logic for API calls
- ⬜️ Add telemetry for monitoring API usage and issues

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization

- ⬜️ Implement Google-recommended lazy loading patterns
- ⬜️ Add image/resource preloading for map assets
- ⬜️ Optimize render cycles for map components
- ⬜️ Create benchmark tests for performance validation

### Phase 4: Mobile-Desktop Standardization

- ⬜️ Create responsive components that adapt to both platforms
- ⬜️ Standardize gesture handling across devices
- ⬜️ Implement platform-specific optimizations via single interface
- ⬜️ Use adaptive precision based on device capabilities

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation

- ⬜️ Develop comprehensive test suite for all map functionality
- ⬜️ Create performance benchmarking tools
- ⬜️ Validate battery and data usage metrics
- ⬜️ Test across multiple device types and browsers

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Complete Phase 1 and prepare for Phase 2
2. **Week 2-3**: Implement Phase 2 and begin Phase 3
3. **Week 4-5**: Complete Phase 3 and implement Phase 4
4. **Week 6**: Conduct testing and validation (Phase 5)
5. **Week 7**: Roll out to production and monitor

## Best Practices to Follow

1. **API Key Security**:
   - Never expose API keys in client-side code
   - Use API key restrictions (HTTP referrers, IP addresses)
   - Implement proper key rotation and monitoring

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Load only required Google Maps libraries
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Use markers clustering for large datasets
   - Defer non-essential map operations

3. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Prioritize battery-efficient implementations
   - Use geolocation sporadically and with purpose
   - Implement predictive algorithms to reduce API calls
   - Optimize rendering for mobile devices

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement graceful degradation when APIs fail
   - Provide meaningful error messages to users
   - Track and report errors for analysis
